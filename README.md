# Forward_List
Implementing the forward_list api<br>
You have to download GoogleUnitTest if you want to use the tests.<br>
There are some nice recursive function that I implemented for fun, this functions start with "Rec".(so iterative solution and recursive solution are there for some function)<br>
Most of the API is the same as the original, but there may be some changes because I did not implement allocator, and tried to make a safe list with exception instead
undefined behavior.<br>
The description of the function in the files.<br>
Note that I tried to  optimization, but did not if the code become ugly, that it won't be like the source code of c++.<br>
TODO: <br>
 1)implement get_alloc<br>
 2)Implement all constructors(and some with allocator which i need to learn)<br>
 3)Iterators function and const Iteartor<br>
4)implement Uniqe<br>
5)splice_after<br>
6)resize<br>
7)Valgrind-memory check.
