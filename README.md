# Forward_List
Implementing the forward_list api<br>
There are some nice rec function that i implemented for fun.<br>
Most of the api is the same as the original, but there may be some changes because i did not implement allocator, and tried to make safe list with exception instead
undefined behaviour.<br>
The description of the function in the files.<br>
Note that i tried to  optimization, but did not if the code become ugly, that it wont be like source code of c++.<br>
TODO: <br>
 1)implement get_alloc<br>
 2)Implement all constructors(and some with allocator which i need to learn)<br>
 3)Iterators function and const Iteartor<br>
4)implement Uniqe<br>
5)splice_after<br>
6)resize<br>
